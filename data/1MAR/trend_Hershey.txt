WHY do you let a MAN who hates women and wants to silence us, represent WOMEN on International Women’s Day?

Growing up, I had thick hair and a million cowlicks. My mom frequently took on my knotty mane with detangler, wet brush, scissors — and comfort me with a Hershey bar.

If Hersheys is giving trans kids comfort with representation, support them - don’t #BoycottHersheys!

The reaction to my inclusion as a trans woman in Hersheys Canada’s IWD campaign shows just how far we still have to go in the fight for feminist liberation and trans rights.

I’m not going anywhere. I’m not shutting up. I will always stand up for women and girls, cis and trans.

As soon as you use even one bloke for your pro-women activism, the real women become props. They become nothing more than "proof" that the man belongs, and validation of his and your delusion. They become background.

It's the exact opposite of pro-women. twitter.com/FaeJohnstone/s…

To celebrate International Women’s Day- Hersheys uses a MAN in their advert to advertise their new women’s chocolate range ‘Her For She’. 

This is a true insult to women! 

International Women’s Day is about celebrating the achievements of women not MEN!

Hersheys needs to sell their sugary, fat filled candy to those most likely to eat it. 

Who better to sell to than transwomen? Studies show they are more likely to be depressed than the average person.

They can now eat their feelings.
