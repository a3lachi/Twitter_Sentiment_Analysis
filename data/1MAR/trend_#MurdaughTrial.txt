My brother in law killed my sister, his wife on Valentine’s Day. He gave her flowers and a card expressing his love for her the night before. They were married over 20 yrs. Men kill women they love and they steal from people they love.  #MurdaughTrial #MurdaughMuders

He just pointed to exactly what started my suspicions of Alex being guilty. 

His mama, with Alzheimer’s, after 2100? Nah. That’s an alibi. She would have sundown by then and been asleep. 

We didn’t visit my Pa after dark, visiting would confuse and upset him.

It was what Paul was going to do NEXT — send the video that his Dad’s voice was just captured on.

Rogan was eager to have the video to see the problem with his dog’s tail.

Paul finished taping but never sent it.

AM was RIGHT THERE, and he is GUILTY.

6. Paul’s video not only puts AM at the scene; it also pinpoints the time of death.
7. Paul was in convo via text with Rogan about his dog & last contact was RoRo: OK shoot the vid then send it to me
8. PM gets busy making vid, which establishes AM is there
9. PM never sends vid.

That scenario from the "D",  something about ppl wanting the jurors to think he hosed himself down in the kennels before riding to the main house, "NAKED", on a golf cart, is oddly specific. It actually answers a lot of questions

#MurdaughTrial Murdaugh is looking amazingly guilty during the John Meador's defense rebuttal. I think he's  nailing it and taking just the right tone with the jury. And the person who knows it is Murdaugh. He looks freaked.

I was accused by a MAGAt of saying Murdaugh was guilty only because he is trump supporter. I only knew he was probably a trump supporter because he lies so damn much. That trump supporting hypocrite said he would acquit him. So we know what could happen.
