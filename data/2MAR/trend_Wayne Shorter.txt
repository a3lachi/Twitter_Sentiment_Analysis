Today, we just lost one of the greatest saxophonists, composers, musicians, geniuses, period, of all time: Wayne Shorter, 89. I never got to meet Wayne, but he was one of the most important influences on everything I've done. He's always been "the other side" of me... RIP, king.

"I think that music opens portals and doorways into unknown sectors that it takes courage to leap into. I always think that there's a potential that we all have, and we can emerge, rise up to this potential, when necessary."
