KATIE HOBBS vetos the AZ budget. Can't get anything done. 

Now she's lashing out at the AZ Republican-led House/Senate, declaring: "I’m committing $500k to flip the AZ House/Senate in ‘24." 

AZ Republicans, stop complaining, let's win supermajorities in the AZ House/Senate.

Exactly. These data points are more than enough to flag the 2022 AZ election fraudulent and invalid. Katie Hobbs is not the governor.

A long running investigation has turned up a huge scandal. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs and many others may be involved. Cartel money laundering, election rigging, bribery and racketeering are some of the allegations.

KATIE HOBBS LOSES AGAIN

Katie Hobbs nominated Matthew Stewart to be next Director of Arizona's Department of Child Safety. 

I knew from within the department, that Stewart had lots of baggage. But Hobbs apparently didn't care.

Finally, she pulled his name from nomination.

The nice thing about a RICO case is it is not about charging individuals for specific crimes, all you need to do is have evidence that inviduals were part of the racketeering organization. Katie Hobbs' fraud against Kari Lake has brought lawyers and politicians into the mix now.
