This is what the Cleveland Plain Dealer today ran in the spot where Dilbert usually runs. They are replacing the strip (but will run the gray box until they find a new strip) after Adams' racist rant. Good for us, Cleveland!

During all of Scott Adams’ years-long racist white boy bitch schtick, I had no idea DILBERT was STILL running. Congrats to the brave newspapers who cut ties… today?

White people should “get the hell away from Black people” 

Dilbert cartoonist, Scott Adams, pulled his Klan mask all the way off. I respect the white supremacy rhetoric he spouted with his whole chest. 

Followed that cartoon for decades…I’m such a mug.

It's OK to be Dilbert Guy.

Over there. Way over there. Yes, right there.

Wait, I can still hear you. Keep going.

Eh, a little further to be sure.

Yeah, there we go.

Ignorant extremists have turned into what resembles 12 year old gamers chatting online. He has a perfect opportunity to sell millions of racist Dilbert comics to these extremist delinquents. Right up their alley while screaming about Potato Heads and shoes on M&Ms.

Not gonna link to it but I see my decision to stop reading Dilbert two decades ago continues to be proven the correct one.

He is a cartoonist and draws the Dilbert cartoons. He is voicing his opinion about something which bothers him. You don't have to care or respond. I frequently skim over comments and pass on responding. It is nice to know how other people think.

Hey 
@AMSyndication
: I love Dilbert, but I'm very unhappy hearing Scott Adams say these things. Maybe it's time to cut ties.

To all the newspapers dropping #Dilbert comics because of something racist the creator said, I would suggest you start running 
@stone_toss
 comics. He's a very talented man and regularly features transsexuals in his comics!

I will never read your comic again. I will write to both of the papers I subscribe to and tell them to watch your repulsive, racist white supremacist diatribe. You are disgusting and unAmerican.

It’s now clear for everyone to see that Dilbert cartoonist, Scott Adams, is a full blown white supremacist. He said all black ppl are a “hate group”, he wont help Black America anymore (as if we asked for his racist ass help). And for white ppl to stay far away from black ppl.

Dilbert guy is dialing up the racism to get "canceled" because he realizes he can make more money and do less work on the right wing grievance circuit
