People are so nice. I was sent this cast and crew pic by a young lady in this pic. I received an OK from Sony to use it for my book. This group of amazing talented people worked happily together, and that is why "The Jeffersons" lasted 11 seasons. #70s #tvtime #Hits #Awards

It wasn’t a spinoff.

And I don’t need to be “NiCe” to someone coming on my post being loud and wrong. The only thing the main cast of “Amen” and “The Jeffersons” have in common is Sherman Hemsley. All Black people don’t look alike. This is the cast of “The Jeffersons”

Jefferson best captured the spirit of the revolutionary movement when he wrote "The colonists felt that submission to what they saw as tyranny was not an American art."

Where are the Jeffersons, Adams, Washingtons, Paines, etc? Our republic is slowly dying before our eyes.

Sadly they forgot there were tv shows in the 1970s and 1980s that show interracial marriage, and no one gave a shit back then. One noticeable show that featured a white guy and a black woman married was called “The Jeffersons”.

but the 1st depiction of a transgender woman in a sitcom was Vanessa Redd on The Jeffersons in 1977.  By the end of the episode George accepts his friend for living her truth. Yet in 2023 bigoted politicians are trying to erase entire groups of people by passing regressive laws.
