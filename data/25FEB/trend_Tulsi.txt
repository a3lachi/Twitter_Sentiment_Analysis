Tulsi Gabbard calls out the left for hiring by race:

"They’re proud to be selecting people based on race...  It’s based on genetics... Where do we see that connection? These are the very same core principles embodied by Nazism and Adolph Hitler."

Tulsi Gabbard will say anything in front of a camera in order to pretend that she is still relevant. Her comparison of Biden to Hitler confirms her Republican mentality and instincts.

Flew in tonight, headed to East Palestine.  Came to see firsthand what Biden & Buttigieg refuse to. Biden has time & another $500M of our $$$ for Zelensky, but no time or money for people here who are still getting sick days after the water & air were supposedly declared “clear.”

What is it with Tulsi Gabbard comparing Biden to Hitler because he appoints many qualified people who don’t happen to be straight, White Christian males? You’d think as a Hindu woman of Pacific Islander ancestry, who has profited from her background, she’d think twice about that.

We are not the silent majority. America First is quite loud. It's the fake Biden voters that are the silent majority. Silent because they don't exist other than a photocopy or an algorithm on a Dominion machine.

This is vintage Tulsi. For years I warned that my former congresswoman was a bigoted fraud, Assad apologist, Russian asset, and secret right wing nut job. This is the latest in the long list of her abominations.

Tulsi Gabbard says WWIII only ends in a nuclear holocaust:

"We're either going to work towards peace, de-escalate tensions, move away from this new cold war, or we will continue to race rapidly towards nuclear war."

दहेज न देने पर जहां समाज में बेटी को प्रताड़ित किया जाता है। वहीं संत रामपाल जी महाराज जी के ज्ञान से सादगी से हो रहे हैं दहेज मुक्त विवाह। सास-ससुर द्वारा बहू को घर में दिया जाता है बेटी के समान दर्जा ।

“Too often U.S. sanctions are levied against another country in the attempt to ‘punish’ that country’s leader without consideration of what the real impact of those sanctions are,” Gabbard said in a statement. “In reality, these sanctions are like a https://nationalinterest.org/blog/skeptics/tulsi-gabbard-wants-know-if-us-sanctions-are-killing-children-165342……

Tulsi regularly bashes both parties and "the system" with vague criticisms, then says, "I will continue to seek ways to help lead change." Remarks like this are empty platitudes. Until she makes specific, verifiable charges and proposes solutions, she's just grifting (as usual).
