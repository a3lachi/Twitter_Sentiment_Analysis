There’s a percentage who’s driven past the racist narrative I respect more than most. But something’s gotta change.

Scott Adams’s amazing logic:
For 240 years we tormented POC with slavery.

I found a survey that says 1/2 of them are upset about this. 
Therefore the only solution is to torment them more.

I'm not doing interviews until end of year but there's nothing to discuss on this because everyone agrees.

Scott Adams (Dilbert cartoonist) is a Nazi.  No wonder his trophy wife (#2?) left him in a matter of weeks.

It’s one of the reasons I’m grateful and excited by the new FSoY pamphlet. It can make for a laboratory of seeking personal revelation for our young people - and that’s a skill they’re desperately going to need in coming days.

"Canada doesn't even have an air force that can shoot down a balloon".  

Can't make this shit up folks.  The great Scott Adams is on point with his observations about Canada being totally dysfunctional.

His problem with the Scott Adams video is that he objected to blacks saying whites shouldn't exist? Lol

Scott Adams video should be treated as the performative transactional example of ally ship that is easy to reject. We expect it from ppl like Scott. We know when they receive pushback, this type behavior is not unusual, it’s pretty typical if not par for the course as they say

Scott Adams finally says the quiet part out loud.

"The best advice I can give to white people is get the hell away from Black people."

I wonder what all the newspapers that still carry Dilbert think of this?

I’m not defending how he handled it. Just adding the context so you know it was fake news.

Sounds to me like Scott Adams is reacting to factual information. Did you know that 3% of the population (young black men) commit 50% of the homicides in this country. Then information comes out saying most blacks don't think it's OK to be white. Adams is right.

Awhile back, Adams claimed he had been fired because he was white and that he was going to get confirmation from the folks who fired him that that really happened. I haven’t seen the confirmation yet. twitter.com/scottadamssays…

What's particularly hilarious about the Scott Adams thingie is that searching his name brings up multiple accounts named shit like "The Rational Racialist" with paid blue ticks ranting about how they're tired of having to hide and pretend they're not openly racist

THIS is also today, and why black people do poorly, not "systemic racism". "Do the work" and black people will do well. Scott Adams is right, we need to stop pandering to people who hate us & don't take responsibility for their lives
