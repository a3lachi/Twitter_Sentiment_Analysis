I don't worry about being killed by an immigrant. 

I worry about being killed by a Fox News watching, AR-15 owning, mad because Biden won, looking for a fight, domestic terrorist, who needs a Day of Hate to make sure everyone knows what losers they are.

It sure does seem like a psyop. Possibly they're planning some false flag attack tomorrow. "Day of hate" implies persecution, thus ADL-friendly theme. Prosecution isn't hate.

Isn’t everyday Day of Hate for antisemitic fuckfaces? They should celebrate Day of Literacy, that’d be unusual for them and worth celebrating.

When nothing happens on the day of hate, I will mock your people forever for believing literally anything people tell you as long as you can pretend to be a victim.

I have never & would never vote for Trump. But I thought #antisemitism would get better with Biden, & spoiler alert- it’s not. Feels worse, actually. Job of president is to protect safety of citizens, correct?  Why is there a Day of Hate? I want answers.

 We WILL not become a nation of hate! We must stand in love & solidarity with our Jewish friends & family to drown out such disgraceful antiAmerican behavior! Take their pics, send them to the newspapers & post them online! Let their employers see…

BREAKING: Law enforcement in the US is warning that Neo-Nazi groups in the US plan to hold rallies and hand out anti-Jewish, anti-semitic fliers this Saturday in what they call a "National Day of Hate".

As a Jewish American, this makes me sick to my stomach.  Meanwhile many…

Neo-Nazi groups are reportedly organizing a national “Day of Hate” against Jews on Saturday.

We will not be intimidated.

We are resilient.

We are strong.

We are #JewishandProud.

Until today, I had heard nothing about this planned day known as 'Day of Hate' which is supposed to go after Jewish people. If anyone harms one person, or does damage to a place of worship I don't care what color, religion or political affiliation they are with. Arrest them.

Imagine declaring a national day of hate. A national day of hate against Jews. A holiday of hate. Where they can all get together and hate. Hate Jews. “They should all drop down dead”…my Bubby

A shameful day when our nation and communities brace for a “Day of Hate”. 
It is hard for me to fathom the mindset that supports such abhorrent actions. 

It is not hard for me to overtly and loudly reject them.

NEW: Several police departments around the United States are warning Jews of extremist groups planning a “Day of Hate” for Saturday. 

The Day of Hate appears to have been in the works for a while. @jdforward

Why is there a Day of Hate and WHY is it being PROMOTED all over??? This is part of the reason there is so much division in this country and the world. THIS SHOULD NOT BE PROMOTED AT ALL!!!
