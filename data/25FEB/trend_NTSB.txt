Even if Trump didn't roll back the ECP Braking Rule, it would not have applied to the Norfolk Southern train that derailed in Ohio because it was not categorized as a high-hazard cargo train.

The Obama era regulations did not have provisions that would have affected the East Palestine derailment. Those rules only applied to oil tankers, not all liquid cargo.

The NTSB head has explicitly stated electronic breaking systems wouldn’t have prevented the derailment.

Except the NTSB has 1) said the rule in question wouldn't have applied to this type of train and 2) the crash was called by an overheated ball bearing not the brakes. Sorry chump

Mayor Pete’s trip to Palestine Ohio was nothing more than a political stunt used to attack Donald Trump with false accusations that are completely refuted by the historical record and the NTSB preliminary report that says the BRAKES functioned exactly as intended.

Typical conservative troll..... The DOT has nothing to do with accidents and NTSB has been there from the beginning and conservative politicians have been underfunding and deregulating the EPA for years.... You cannot be a Christian and a conservative at the same time.

Responsibility is Trump’s who set aside former safety regs. You don’t have to be on site to get things done although if other pressing national concerns allowed, he ought to have made a humanitarian visit sooner-unless he was too much occupied coordinating efforts for Palestine.
