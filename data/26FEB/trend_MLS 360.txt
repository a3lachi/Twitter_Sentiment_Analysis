notes for MLS 360 producer:

- more soccer, less analysis

Re: MLS on Apple: 1) Free sure was nice. 2) If I gotta pay, this may be worth it. 3) MLS 360 is great, but we don’t need to watch commenters talk. Stick with the action. 4) Best-looking season kit-wise, but who in St. Louis decided new team should dress like 1950s gym class?

So we’re 45 minutes into MLS 360 and between the commercials, the host shots, 8:30 pre game look ins and mid game tifo reviews, I think we MAY have seen about 10 minutes of actual soccer.

I want to like this show and I expect they’ll take the feedback and improve it next week.

-Would rather them not tell me a goal has happened before I’ve seen it

 MLS 360 should be about the games the entire time. This weird hybrid style approach and with commercials is disappointing. In 35 minutes of action you’ve shown only the games for 5-10 minutes

A lot has been made of #MLSSeasonPass and the league's paywall move (via Apple TV). 

But MLS 360, the new whiparound show with highlights that shows every goal, is worth the price of subscription. That, plus the production quality on this setup is

the actual video portion of MLS 360 is too small and it's not really making room for any must-see information or anything. won't be able to handle it if there's always commercials, but video quality of everything is class.

My one critique of the MLS 360 thing is having them turned around to watch the games and just having a shot of their backs. Not great TV need an alternate angle or facing camera. Otherwise I like it.

Make sure to not have the analysts and hosts backs turned away from the camera during MLS 360. It feels really awkward to see the back of their heads as they watch the game and talk to each other. Feels like we as the audience are not apart of it.

It’s taking them too long to get to actual in-game action. Also, their side convos are very distracting.

The beauty of NFL RedZone is you get all action in near real-time and hear the play-by-play of the games you’re watching.

MLS 360 just feels awkward.

For me MLS 360 is the worst part of MLS Season Pass so far. LOTS of commercial breaks, too many side convos, and they don’t show actual game action the entire time so you miss key moments. Doesn’t do for MLS what RedZone did for the NFL, unfortunately.

It was always unlikely that fans from one market were going to tune-in to watch two "random" teams play a full match.

I'll wager that most avid fans will - regardless of market - now put MLS 360 on in the background for casual viewing.

That's a very good thing.

Anything could happen until they officially announce, but it keeps in line the Decision Day model of all East teams then all West plus it lets Apple run their pregame, MLS 360 special, and full post game after around their usual timeframe.

The 360 show on MLS Season Pass looks pretty bad ass. I tend to follow the live standings anyway. #MLS #360 #MLSSeasonPass #football #soccer

MLS 360 has made adjustments within the last hr of streaming and its much better. Soccer is a tough sport for a whiparound because of the spontaneity of scoring but they’re doing a solid job.

Watching MLS 360 today to get a feel for all the games happening tonight and for the most part have enjoyed it.

Wish they went to announcers more and I think the crew needs some  more time to gel as it is awkward at some times, but overall a solid start for Apple  TV  coverage.

In addition to a new workflow for live games, the league is opening up a new production facility in East Harlem.

This will be the home to MLS 360, a whip-around show, as well as studio shows MLS Countdown and MLS Wrap-up. #MLSisBack

Mis pensamientos del MLS 360:

- Debe mostrar más acción real
- Sobran muchas tomas a locutores
- Faltan inserciones GFX
- MLS Countdown "interrumpe"
- ¿Por qué hay pausas comerciales?
- Concepto lejos de ser NFL RedZone
- Esto no es un goal-cast
- Incómoda 1ª ejecución del show

 Very disappointed by first week of MLS 360. Too many studio shots, not enough live game action. And I will never watch a show with commercials while games are live. Cardinal sin of football broadcasting. Really poor judgement by Apple. Hope changes are made.

I'm confident Apple holds up their end of the bargain, so it's partly up to MLS to put a product on the field that people are willing to pay $80+ for

Price wise should be fair with every game, no blackouts, cross channel, and enhanced coverage (i.e MLS 360, 1080p etc)

MLS 360 can be great, and studio crews take time to iron out. But this was really good before Twellman showed up, and he took all the oxygen for himself tonight. Balance and elevating BWP and SK will be key; if he’s intent on dominating the conversation, the show will suffer.
