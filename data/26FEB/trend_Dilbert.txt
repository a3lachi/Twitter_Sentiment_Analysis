Dilbert creator Scott Adams got cancelled for calling black people "a hate group" because a poll found half of them are not ok with white people.
Race grifters often call white people racist, but the evidence shows white people are least racist while black people are most racist.

Conservatives only love the “free market” when it’s not exercising it’s freedom. 

Anytime the market stands for something they lose their minds.

Both Dilbert and Scott Adams can fuck all-the-way off. 

It doesn’t affect my life either way.

If you're a free market champion, the response of newspapers in dropping "Dilbert" shouldn't surprise you. If anything, you should be celebrating. The market responded, free of government intervention. It worked just as you hoped. Demand for "Dilbert" is down, so supply follows.

Why did Scott Adams throw away Dilbert?
Was he tired of writing the comic strip?
Does he think he can make more money giving talks to crazy wingnut groups?
I think those are the two main reasons but I wonder what the other possibilities are.

White people should “get the hell away from Black people” 

Dilbert cartoonist, Scott Adams, pulled his Klan mask all the way off. I respect the white supremacy rhetoric he spouted with his whole chest. 

Followed that cartoon for decades…I’m such a mug.

The snarky, anti-black racisit assumed he would always speak with impunity. He is cornered by his own words, trying to make a case that the video was "edited." It's jaw dropping to see legions of racist trolls and white supremacists come to his defense.
