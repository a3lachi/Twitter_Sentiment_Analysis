I am watching Purdue’s 7-4 Zach Edey play quality Big Man basketball for the 4th or 5th time, and if it’s true there is no longer a place in the NBA for him I am officially disgusted with the hostile takeover of the three, which has distorted basketball at every level.

From last 2 games I have seen players on foul line lock arms to block Edey out. Not only is that an infraction but it is very dangerous. I also saw this hook & hold against Edey & no call. No way can such blatant violations be missed by not 1, not 2 but 3 officials.

The real reason people are mad at these offensive foul calls is they're not consistently called all season. By the letter of the law, what Edey and Jenkins did were fouls. But many players on many teams get away with that consistently - even if there's some embellishment too

OSU went to Horns Chicago a lot. This time it was for Sueing on the Chicago action. You see Gillis go under on the DHO to get back in front. Sueing still gets a step, but Edey is right there moving with him at the rim.

This is such a sweet save by Smith

OSU went to Horns Chicago a lot. This time it was for Sueing on the Chicago action. You see Gillis go under on the DHO to get back in front. Sueing still gets a step, but Edey is right there moving with him at the rim.

This is such a sweet save by Smith

The fact Edey is now -5000 to win player of the year is a joke. If it truly is “player” of the year and not whose the better team of the year then I don’t really get it. I understand if he’s still the favorite but to be that outrageously favored makes no sense to me.

If Purdue loses at home to IU… TJD will win the national player of the year award. Should he? No, especially if Edey has the better individual performance like he did in Bloomington. But the national media is obsessed with IU and head-to-head is the narrative angle they can use.

Don’t make any plans for the second weekend of the NCAA tournament Purdue fans. They don’t have a reliable number 2 option and their guards can be rattled on both ends. The Edey matchup nightmare is one hell of an advantage but it can’t be your only source of offense.

When it reaches that point it is time to take the matter in to your own hands. Stop talking about it the next few days. Deal with it on the floor. If Edey is hooked n held and they refuse to look at it, instruct him to rip their arm off. It’s his safety or theirs.

TJD is the clear player of the year putting those numbers up while being double and triple teamed every possession. Edey mostly gets single coverage and at that size should have a huge rebounding edge. The Blocks and Assists edge that TJD has is also big time.
