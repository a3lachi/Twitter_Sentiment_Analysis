This win speaks insane volumes about #iubb's resiliency as a team. The mental toughness on display tonight can't be overstated.

Jalen Hood-Schifino and Trey Galloway were the clear-cut difference makers. Massive "we will fight you to the very end" performance on the road.

Things that will go unmentioned:

3. Trey Galloway.

4. Two of the most clutch timeouts I've ever seen called.

Incredible effort all around by #iubb. Major credit to Trey Galloway. Since his injury last year, he’s seen a major improvement on the offensive end to add to his defense. This is what us fans clamored for, the role players stepped up big time on top of JHS massive effort

I am watching Purdue’s 7-4 Zach Edey play quality Big Man basketball for the 4th or 5th time, and if it’s true there is no longer a place in the NBA for him I am officially disgusted with the hostile takeover of the three, which has distorted basketball at every level.

Indiana is all of a sudden up 44-40 on Purdue.

It's okay because IU's other hyphenated surname, Jalen Hood-Schifino, has 25.

In fact, JHS, Trey Galloway, & Miller Kopp have all 44.

Trey Galloway's improvement as a 3-point shooter has been one of the underrated stories of IU's season. He's up over 50% after hitting 21% last season and 18% as a freshman. 8-6 Boilers.

By the time I sent the above tweet, it was actually 47-39. Trey Galloway nailed a 3, Race Thompson stole the inbound pass and laid the ball in off a pass from Galloway.

Jalen Hood-Schifino's foul trouble in the first half was the signpost that sent Indiana's offense to oblivion late in the half. Although Miller Kopp and Trey Galloway have been OK scoring-wise tonight, Indiana is just a bit too dependent on its big two for offensive flow.
