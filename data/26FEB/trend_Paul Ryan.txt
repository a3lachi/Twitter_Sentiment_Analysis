During the coup, Pence STRUGGLED to do the right thing. He practically begged Dan Quayle, asking him over and over if there was any flexibility in the 12th amendment. No one should be surprised that he’s too much of a coward to tell investigators and Americans the truth.

Paul Ryan did everything he could to try to sabotage Trump in his first two years in office. That didn’t work out too well. Then he got a big position on the FOX board, now pushing so hard for Ronald Desantis. That also won’t work. A vote for DeSantis is a vote for Paul Ryan.
