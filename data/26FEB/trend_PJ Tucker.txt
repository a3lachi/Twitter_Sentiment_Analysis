The first half from PJ Tucker against the Celtics is exactly why the 76ers were so aggressive in acquiring him (and tampering lol) 

- 7 points (2-2 from 3pt) 
- 11 rebounds (game high by 5) 
- +19 (game high by +5)

Playoff intensity and great hustle and defense

I love how Jokić-stans completely ignore the last Sixers-Nuggets game because Embiid was so obviously the better player and cite a bunch of stats instead.  Jokić couldn’t score on PJ Tucker (who’s 6’5) and Embiid took away easy layups for cutters.  Embiid dropped 47 on his head.

The Celtics have made their run, and after three quarters, they lead the Sixers 80-78. Massive stretch coming to open the fourth quarter as the Sixers try to survive with Embiid on the bench. Best guess is that Paul Reed remains on the bench and they go to PJ Tucker at the five.

If Santi is going to be a big man like everyone says, he has to be able to rebound an Embiid missed free throw over PJ Tucker. A lot went wrong in the 4th but watch that play again and tell me he is an NBA 4 or 5. I’d rather have Roddy on that low block there. Santi is a wing.

Opened Mike Malone’s eyes that an offense can be run through a big man in a capacity. If Mike doesn’t coach Boogie, harder to believe he’s as open to allowing Jokic game to flourish the way it has. I get what you mean completely, people saying “Jokic clears” and shit don’t get it

PJ Tucker didn’t lock up . If  Embiid is such a great defender why are the 6ers afraid to have him guard Joker? They really “ruined” the Nuggets offense, the Nuggets put up 119. Such . Enjoy a 3rd straight MVP runner-up and most valuable Philadelphian award though.

There's this thing called positioning, and positioning Embiid on Jokic drew him out of his home in the paint, which left it wide open for dunks. That same Jokic got clamped up by PJ Tucker, which is more pathetic than anything Joel has ever done

Embiid is anchoring a top 4 defense and his starting team mates are:
James Harden - notoriously bad defender
Tyrese Maxey - undersized, skinny young guard who can't defend

Watching Jokic orchestrate a 70+ point 1st half on the road.. o think it was a 20+ point lead? 

Embiid popped off when Jokic got switched onto PJ Tucker man. 

He didn’t hang all 47 of his points on Jokic. Not sure what you were watching.

A little tidbit for you: In all of FGC esports, there are only 47 people who’ve made over $100,000 in career prize earnings, and that’s spanning nearly 30 years of competition over many games. Considering how many years you need to spend to get good, 100,000 is actually nothing.

Not sure this play happens without PJ Tucker sacrificing his body. 
Not sure if it was a charge or block, but props to him for the sacrifice.

Yeah and also Embiid might have balled out of his mind against Nuggets, but it was PJ Tucker who won that game for 76s when he started guarding Jokić

PJ tucker hitting him before the block helps but that’s ok

He’s right, getting locked up by a 37 year old pj tucker who’s 7 inches shorter than him is outrageous

He has had his teammates injured for the last 2 seasons that he won MVP, and now that they’re healthy, he’s far and away leading the nuggets to the 1 seed in the most stacked west we’ve seen in decades. This is the last shot he has at getting the job done before the media turns

You’re right, it USED to be a the standard to run the offense through bigs when Mike’s dad coached in the league, but the NBA Mike has been apart of has had a drastically different philosophy. I did make an assumption, but it’s simply a line of thinking that makes sense.

Certain ones do, but specifically fighting games make literally negative money, it’s goofy to me to think that there’s a scene at all around most fighting games
