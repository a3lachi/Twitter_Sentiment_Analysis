If you are DC Defenders, do you turn to D’Eriq King as QB1? 

I know he hasn’t thrown the ball a lot yet, but if you saw him at Houston/Miami in college, he has a cannon.

I like Jordan Ta'amu's hustle and hard work, but he doesn't ignite this teams' resolve and passion like D'Eriq King does. Just saying. I've seen King play ever since he was a freshman in college and that dude has some magic to him when he gets going.

The Defenders relied solely on the run after replacing Jordan Ta’amu with D’Eriq King.

King didn’t throw a pass tonight and the Defenders put up 230 yards on the ground.

The Defenders trailed 6-0 put up 18 unanswered (15 in the fourth quarter) to win 18-6.

I think the XFL would benefit from pursuing small, dynamic QBs that are exciting to watch but just don’t have the physical frame for the NFL. I think that’s why PJ Walker was so successful. He had playmaking ability but his height didn’t hold him back the way it does in the NFL.

Abram Smith scores from nine yards out to give the Defenders a 16-6 lead.

D’Eriq King passes to Ethan Wolf for a two-point conversion.

Defenders lead 18-6 with 8:36 to go.

I agree that the spread offense is a good idea! But there is a difference between running a spread offense and literally running the triple option, which is what DC did after conditions made it impossible to pass. D'Eriq King did not throw once.

Rewatching the @XFLDefenders game, I'm surprised more XFL teams didn't go with running QBs. I feel like running QBs give you a big advantage over pocket passers in an alt-league. Teams like Orlando would be much better off with a dual-threat guy.

The #XFLDefenders only chance at winning this game is for them to play D’Eriq King extended snaps at QB and try to run it down the Viper's throats - successfully controlling the clock along the way.

It's always nice when our preseason priors aren't challenged in Week 1. Under OC Fred Kaiss the Defenders profiled as a run-first, 2-QB offense. On Sunday:

* 54.6% rush rate
* Gave QB2 D'Eriq King 25.5% of snaps
* No WR saw more than five targets

The list of former Patriots in the XFL has some wonderful "Remember that guy?!" moments:

WR Josh Gordon
DB De’Vante Bausby
DB Cre'Von LeBlanc
WR Chad Hansen
QB/WR D'Eriq King
DL Trent Harris
CB Will Likely
OT Antonio Garcia
masslive.com
How many of these 17 former Patriots playing in revived XFL do you recognize?
You may remember Josh Gordon, but do you remember Cre'Von LeBlanc's time in New England?

D'eriq King gets swallowed up for a TFL on 4th and 2, turnover on downs!

2:11 left, no timeouts, Seattle has a chance to score still.

Also, inside the 2-minute warnings, out-of-bounds plays and incomplete passes stop the clock again.

After a second INT (by the same defender) for Ben DiNucci, the Defenders got a short field and their athletic QB D'eriq King (sp?) ran it in. On a failed 2-pt try backed up to the 10 yd line, the Sea Dragons' #96 Daniel Joseph is ejected for throwing a punch after the play.

I dont think he'll ever be THE guy but I do believe at the very least he can be a reliable starter or backup. He's done it his whole career. Backup for D'Eriq King in high school. Backup for Feleipe Franks in college. Backup for Brady now in the NFL. Either way I hope he succeeds
